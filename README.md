# Dataplay_Placement_Dashboard
## Power BI Project

Welcome to the Placement Dashboard project! This interactive Power BI dashboard was created to analyze and visualize placement data effectively. It provides valuable insights for educational institutions, students, and recruiters by uncovering trends, tracking performance, and highlighting key placement statistics.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my fellowship with **DataPlay**, where I gained hands-on experience in transforming data into actionable insights. The dashboard helps visualize placement trends across various branches, gender, and companies using a user-friendly interface.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features & Insights

- **Placement Summary**: Displays the total number of students, number of students placed, and overall placement percentage.
- **CTC Analysis**:
  - Best and maximum CTC offered.
  - Breakdown by branch (CSE, ECE, EEE) and degree (B.Tech, M.Tech).
- **Placement by Gender & Branch**: Visual representation of placed students across gender and academic streams.
- **Company-Wise Trends**: Analyzes which companies hired the most and their offered packages.
- **High-Paying Jobs**: Highlights the number of students who received offers greater than 20 LPA.
- **Salary Distribution**: Shows how salary offers are distributed across all placed students.
- **Interactive Filters**: Users can filter by branch, company, gender, and more to explore the data in depth.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Power BI**: For dashboard creation and visualization.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Used to create custom measures and calculated columns (e.g., placement percentage, salary bins).
- **Excel/CSV**: Used as the data source.
